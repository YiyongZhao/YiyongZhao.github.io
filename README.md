(Cover story & Featured article, IF2021=21.949, reported in dozens of domestic and international mainstream media such as Guangming Daily, People's Daily, China News, Science Daily, Phy.org, etc., My contribution: for the cover article, based on the transcriptome and genome, I constructed the largest phylogenetic relationship of Leguminosae to date. Phylogenetic relationships were resolved for five subfamilies, about 30 genome-wide replication events were identified, the evolutionary history of the nitrogen-fixing gene family was explored, and the important role of a new gene in nitrogen fixation was proposed, providing an important basis for germplasm conservation and breeding in the legume family. (The full analyses presented in this article were conducted by me, drafted the original manuscript and made rebuttal.)

(IF2020=49.962, ESI highly cited paper), (my contribution involved in the assembly, annotation, and correction of transcriptome data of the first aquatic early angiosperm genome. Based on 115 transcriptome and genome-wide data, a highly supported phylogenetic tree of flowering plants was constructed, and molecular clock analysis revealed that early angiosperms originated in the early Cretaceous, while highly supporting the phylogenetic relationships within the Water Lily family. Low-copy nuclear genes from the whole genome confirmed that saprophytic camphor was the earliest differentiated angiosperm. Meanwhile, using a comparative genomics approach, the Blue Star water lily was identified as a potential hybrid parent of two cultivars, laying the foundation for genomics in molecular cultivation breeding. (The related analyses of Phylogenomic relationships and divergence time estimations of angiosperms in Figure 1 were conducted by me and drafted the corresponding part manuscript and made rebuttal.)

Due to large scale of hundreds of angiosperm species and many thousands of genes, the molecular evolutionary analyses took a lot of steps and a lot of time. I was able to generate the appropriate gene phylogenies and summarized the results for the purpose of reporting gene duplications at key nodes in the angiosperm phylogeny as reported in this paper.)
